# While usually win_reboot waits until it is fully done before continuing I've seen Server 2019 in CI still waiting
# for things to initialise. By tested if ADWS is available with a simple check we can ensure the host is at least
# ready to test AD. Typically I've found it takes about 60 retries so doubling it should cover even an absolute worst
# case.
